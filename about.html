                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>When I was a young man in the 90's my love of technology and software development started.  The internet, as we knew it then, was all very new and exciting.
                    I had tapped into the world of hosting websites on Angelfire and Geocities, and I competed with friends on who could develop the "best" website.  Those challenges
                    pushed me to become an autodidact with regards to HTML/CSS and I learned a lot of fundamentals that are still used today.  However, the world of web development
                    is also very much a different world than it was back then... but those fundamentals have stuck with me, all these years later, and those feelings of excitement and creativity
                    are still very much the same as they were in those days...</p><br><br>
                <p>I studied C, C/C++, Java, Visual Basic in college. I've participated in many online learning software development programs 
                    and was a part of both Flatiron and Thinkful boot camps where I studied JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Ruby, front-end and back-end design, 
                    and principles. I was fortunate enough to work with many people over those years, and have I have developed a great respect and 
                    fondness for collaborating and sharing ideas with people. Working in a team has helped me to become the developer I am today.
