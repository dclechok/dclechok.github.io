        <p>Hi.  My name is Daniel Lechok.  After working as a supply chain
        specialist for many years, I decided to finally take the leap into
        fullstack engineering at Thinkful.  I've always had a passion for 
        software development and technology, and no matter what
        I've done in life professionally, the desire to become a 
        software engineer has never left me.  I've finally arrived at 
        Thinkful, where I'm working to grow my knowledge, and hone my skills
        in-order to find a career doing something that I'm so passionate
        about - software development.
        </p>
