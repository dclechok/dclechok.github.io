                <p>Hi.  My name is DC Lechok, and I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  After working as a supply chain
                    specialist for many years, I decided to finally take the leap into
                    fullstack engineering at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>.  I've always had a passion for 
                    software development and technology, and no matter what
                    I've done in life professionally, the desire to become a 
                    software engineer has never left me.</p><br>
                    <p>I've finally arrived at 
                    Thinkful, where I'm working to grow my knowledge, and hone my skills
                    in-order to find a career doing something that I'm so passionate
                    about - <em>software development</em>.</p>
